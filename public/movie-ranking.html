<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Cotton-Eyed Joe</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie bar none. Awesome action scenes, immersive storytelling, 
    imaginative sci-fi elements, and incredible visuals all reasons why this is my favorite film.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King</h3>
<p>This was my favorite movie for a long time before I saw Dune 2. 
It is my second movie for a lot of the same reasons why Dune 2 is now my favorite.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I really enjoy the mind-bending sci-fi elements of this film, 
and it also has great action scenes too.</p>
